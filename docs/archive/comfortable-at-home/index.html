      Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitacregreek.com/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God.

      In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.

      &lt;span style=&quot;display: block; font-style: italic; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ll soon be free from earthly trials.&lt;br&gt;This body&#x27;ll sleep in the churchyard.&lt;br&gt;I&#x27;ll drop this weight of all that&#x27;s vile,&lt;br&gt;and go singing home to God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

      Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://singinghome.com/archive/&quot;&gt;journeying with us&lt;/a&gt; as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!",

              Rod arrived back at the house on Thursday evening, March 2. He is
              comfortable in a hospital bed downstairs in the family room, with
              a little bit of oxygen and regular medication, primarily for pain
              management. He has a nice view into the back yard with trees and
              birds, and he has his iPod with lots of favorite songs that he
              enjoys listening to. His grandkids have been able to visit and he
              is having final conversations with them and others in the family.
              Rod asks your forgiveness for any hurt he has caused.

              We are not sure how long he has left with us. It could be days, or
              weeks, or possibly even months. The theme of this website and
              email was chosen because of Rod's love for roots music as a way to
              bring people together in community and fellowship with one another
              and with God. Here is a video from a while back of Rod talking
              about two of his favorite subjects, roots music and biblical
              theology:
