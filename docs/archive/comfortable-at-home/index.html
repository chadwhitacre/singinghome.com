              Rod arrived back at the house on Thursday evening, March 2. He is
              comfortable in a hospital bed downstairs in the family room, with
              a little bit of oxygen and regular medication, primarily for pain
              management. He has a nice view into the back yard with trees and
              birds, and he has his iPod with lots of favorite songs that he
              enjoys listening to. His grandkids have been able to visit and he
              is having final conversations with them and others in the family.
              Rod asks your forgiveness for any hurt he has caused.

              We are not sure how long he has left with us. It could be days, or
              weeks, or possibly even months. The theme of this website and
              email was chosen because of Rod's love for roots music as a way to
              bring people together in community and fellowship with one another
              and with God. Here is a video from a while back of Rod talking
              about two of his favorite subjects, roots music and biblical
              theology:
