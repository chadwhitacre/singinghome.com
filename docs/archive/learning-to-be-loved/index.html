              I've been gradually reading all of your wonderful email messages
              to my dad these past few days. At one point he was overwhelmed
              with emotion, "people really want to say something to me." One of
              the main lessons he learned from his arduous time in the hospital
              was what it means to be loved, by God and by others. "I've been
              talking about this stuff my whole life, now I'm really
              experiencing it." Thank you all for your great love for my dad!
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a couple pictures from yesterday of Rod with his kids and
              (most of) his grandkids. We're having some sweet moments together
              despite discomfort, lack of mobility and energy, and some
              difficulty breathing. Now that we're through the first flurry of
              activity moving back home and getting settled, we'll see how the
              days progress. I expect I'll check in again here late in the week
              or over the weekend.
            </p>
            <p>Glory to God for all things!</p>
