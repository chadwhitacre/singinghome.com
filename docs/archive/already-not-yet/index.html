              If you've sat under Rod Whitacre's teaching for more than five
              minutes, you've likely heard the concept of the already and the
              not yet. We live between times, between Christ's first coming in
              humility and His second coming in glory. His Kingdom is already
              present with us, but not yet fully realized. If you've played
              roots music with Rod, it's likely been out of the
              <em>Already &amp; Not Yet</em> songbook he lovingly compiled and
              edited over the past fifteen years.

                >John Rodgers' memorial service</a
              >, my dad started what seems to be his final turning from the
              already of his life with us to the not yet of his heavenly home.
              He told me he has lost all remaining interest in songs like
              ‚ÄúFroggie Went A-Courtin'.‚Äù He only has ears for ‚ÄúAngel Band‚Äù and
              the like. Here's

              The days of clear-mindedness seem to be behind us. (Though really
              his sight is far clearer than mine. Yesterday morning I was
              sitting with him, talking about the family, and he said, ‚ÄúAre
              those angels over there?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know dad, you tell me.‚Äù) Any
              emails you send now I will read to him, but he may not be
              conscious for it. The nurses tell us we can expect up to a few
              more days of transition from consciousness to full
              unconsciousness, and then some time in unconsciousness before
              death.

              I'll likely let you know of Rod's passing in the coming weeks.
              Please pray for peace for him as he lets go and crosses over, and
              strength for Margaret and Seth. Thank you for all of your love and
              prayers. üôè
