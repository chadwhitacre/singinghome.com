      Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitacregreek.com/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God.

      In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.

      &lt;span style=&quot;display: block; font-style: italic; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ll soon be free from earthly trials.&lt;br&gt;This body&#x27;ll sleep in the churchyard.&lt;br&gt;I&#x27;ll drop this weight of all that&#x27;s vile,&lt;br&gt;and go singing home to God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

      Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://singinghome.com/archive/&quot;&gt;journeying with us&lt;/a&gt; as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!",

              Rod greatly appreciates your messages of love and encouragement,
              and the memories you are sharing. I've read all of them to him
              through yesterday morning (we're up to about 80) though I'm still
              a little backlogged on sending out individual replies. Hopefully
              this weekend I can catch up. Thanks for your patience.

              My dad is comfortable at home and sleeps most of the day. He's
              recovered enough clarity of mind to spend a few minutes a day
              putting the finishing touches on one final project, a workbook to
              accompany his

                >Greek grammar</a

                >Bishop Schereschewsky</a

              twenty-five years in the same chair, slowly and painfully typing
              with two fingers."

              We don't expect 25 years (though God's will be done!). According
              to a nurse, one likely scenario is that Rod will linger in his
              present state for several weeks, and then decline rapidly. My
              mother and I visited Sewickley Cemetery today. We found a "<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS42Ogtf_v0"

                >grave on a green hillside</a
              >," just as my dad has requested. Jess and I live across the
              valley.
            </p>
            <p>
              For now, we feel your love and prayers tangibly. My mother reports
              that she and he and Seth are enjoying sweet, Spirit-filled
              evenings of quiet sitting, prayer, and ukulele songs. Thanks for
              being with us in spirit.
