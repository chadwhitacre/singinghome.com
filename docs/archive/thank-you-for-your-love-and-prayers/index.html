              Rod greatly appreciates your messages of love and encouragement,
              and the memories you are sharing. I've read all of them to him
              through yesterday morning (we're up to about 80) though I'm still
              a little backlogged on sending out individual replies. Hopefully
              this weekend I can catch up. Thanks for your patience.

              My dad is comfortable at home and sleeps most of the day. He's
              recovered enough clarity of mind to spend a few minutes a day
              putting the finishing touches on one final project, a workbook to
              accompany his
              <a

                >Greek grammar</a
              >. His inspiration is
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Isaac_Joseph_Schereschewsky"
                rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                >Bishop Schereschewsky</a
              >, who translated the Bible into Chinese while "sitting for nearly
              twenty-five years in the same chair, slowly and painfully typing
              with two fingers."

              We don't expect 25 years (though God's will be done!). According
              to a nurse, one likely scenario is that Rod will linger in his
              present state for several weeks, and then decline rapidly. My
              mother and I visited Sewickley Cemetery today. We found a "<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS42Ogtf_v0"
                rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                >grave on a green hillside</a
              >," just as my dad has requested. Jess and I live across the
              valley.
            </p>

              For now, we feel your love and prayers tangibly. My mother reports
              that she and he and Seth are enjoying sweet, Spirit-filled
              evenings of quiet sitting, prayer, and ukulele songs. Thanks for
              being with us in spirit.
