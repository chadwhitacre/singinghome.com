              Thanks for following along with Rod Whitacre's journey home, and
              welcome to those who signed up in the past few weeks. You can
              catch up on past emails in the
              <a href="/archive/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">archive</a
              >. We're up over 200 subscribers. Rod has received messages from
              over 150 of you. I usually share your messages with him within a
              day or two of receiving them, even if I'm not able to reply right
              away.

              My dad said recently, "Certainly a lot of these are surprising to
              me. I'm very thankful. It's too easy just to see your own failures
              and sin and not acknowledge the way God has used you to help
              others." Then he pulled out an aphorism I hadn't heard before:
              "You can count the seeds in an apple, but you can't count the
              apples in a seed." I thought that was fitting.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for your continued love and prayers! üôè</p>

              The cancer is progressing. After a couple weeks of relative
              comfort, he recently increased his pain medication, because he has
              noticed pain spreading from his abdomen into his legs. Even so, he
              remains clear-minded (when he's awake), and his spirits are
              strong. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprisingly at peace with spending the rest of my
              life in this bed. That‚Äôs God‚Äôs mercy and the prayers of his people
              somehow.‚Äù Here's a picture of the view from his bed.

              A number of you have asked about my mother, Margaret. She and my
              brother Seth, who lives with them, are the main caretakers for my
              dad. We have hospice nurses coming in several times a week to help
              with medication and hygiene. This week we are adding an additional
              caregiver to the weekly schedule to be there for longer periods.
              We're also settling into regular days that my wife Jessica and I
              will be at their house. The goal is for Margaret and Seth to be
              able to count on more regular breaks. Please pray for strength and
              encouragement for them. Today is day 53 at home, after 42 days in
              the hospital.

              That's the update from over here. I introduced some new friends to
              the Roots Jam songbook yesterday‚Äîmore apple seeds sown. My kids
              visit their Papa once or twice a week to sing songs and raid the
              fridge. He loves it. I hope these emails encourage you to spend
              quality time with your own close friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>Glory to God for all things!</p>
