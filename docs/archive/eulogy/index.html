              Thank you to everyone who joined us on Saturday for Rod's funeral
              and burial. We packed 180 of us into Grace, Edgeworth, and we
              honored him well. Many of you were unable to be with us due to
              weddings and graduations and a busy holiday weekend. We felt your
              presence in the Spirit, and it's wonderful that so many happier
              life milestones accompanied my father's burial.

              Below is the text of the eulogy I gave at the funeral service.
              Several of you asked for it, and I would like it to be part of the
              record of his singing home.

            <p>
              Do you have pictures or videos of the funeral? Can you send them
              to me? Our family would love to have them to remember the event
              by, and I would like to include a few in a final email to you all,
              along with some other photos from Rod's life.

            <p><strong>Eulogy for Rodney Alan Whitacre</strong></p>
            <p>
              <em>Chad Whitacre<br />May 27, 2023</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              ON BEHALF OF my mother Margaret, my brother Seth, my wife Jessica,
              our children Leah, Miriam, Samuel, and Ruth, my aunt and uncle
              Audrey and Clayton Jacobsen, my parents-in-law Michael and Jayne
              Lloyd, and our whole family, I'd like to thank you all for being
              here with us today to give praise and thanks and worship to
              Almighty God for the life of His servant, Rodney.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to Father Michael Hustead, Brian Buckley, Earl Johns and
              all the people of Grace Church for your hard work in organizing
              today's events, and for all of your love and fellowship over the
              years. My dad loved you all and enjoyed being with you so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to Bishop David Hicks for being with us, and to all of
              the bishops and clergy of the Reformed Episcopal Church who have
              been so supportive. Thank you to Archbishop Robert Duncan for
              being here with us as well, and representing Bishop Alex Cameron
              and the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to Steve and Peggy Noll and to Molly Henning and to all
              of the Trinity community who walked in love with my dad, and
              studied the Gospel of John with my dad, and learned Greek from my
              dad, and traveled to Greece and Israel with my dad, and prayed
              contemplatively with my dad, and played ukulele with my dad. He
              lived a rich and full life together with you, to God's glory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to all of you who have walked with us in a special way
              since Rod left the hospital on March 2 to go singing home to God.
              Thank you for all of the messages you sent and for all of your
              love and prayers. My dad expressed multiple times over the past
              months how appreciative he was for the prayers of God's people.
              God used your prayers mightily to help Rodney receive His mercy at
              the end and enter His rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to all of the wonderful nurses and other medical
              professionals who helped us care for him, and thank you to all of
              the funeral staff and caterers and others who are helping us today
              with the services and the reception. Everyone is invited back here
              to the church this afternoon after the commital, where our family
              looks forward to greeting you and hearing your own stories about
              Rod.
            </p>
            <p>
              NOW, IN THE NAME of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
              Spirit, let us praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us!
            </p>
            <p>
              Rodney Alan Whitacre was a saint, a spiritual giant. He was not
              perfect, but he strove against the passions with great might in
              the desert of his heart for 73 years to be perfect as his heavenly
              Father is perfect. The desert fathers teach that, ‚ÄúIf you are a
              theologian, you will pray truly. And if you pray truly, you are a
              theologian.‚Äù Rod Whitacre was a theologian in the full sense. He
              taught and preached the Word of God, particularly the Gospel of
              John, particularly in the original Greek; and he prayed truly,
              particularly the Jesus Prayer. Rod was filled with the Grace of
              the Holy Spirit, and his life bore the fruit of the Spirit: love,
              joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
              gentleness, and self-control. For those with ears to hear it,
              Rod's home-going was miraculously guided by God every step of the
              way, through the prayers of God's people, and, for those who can
              hear it, through the miraculous intervention of Saint John the
              Wonderworker, Saint Chad, and Saint Nathanael. Rod leaves a deep
              and lasting spiritual legacy that will resound for generations, to
              God's glory.
            </p>
            <p>
              The word eulogy of course comes from the Greek, and it means a
              good word, so allow me to share a good word or two with you from
              Rod's life story. I have Father Michael's permission to go for
              about 20 minutes here, so settle in. But first, allow me to frame
              Rod's story with a little theology‚Äîand with a little roots music.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main theological concepts Rod worked with was, ‚Äúthe
              already and not yet.‚Äù What does this mean? This means that we live
              in a time fundamentally characterized by tension. We live between
              Christ's first coming in humility, and His second coming in glory.
              The Kingdom of God is already present in and among us‚ÄîKing Jesus
              is already on His throne‚Äîbut we still await the final consummation
              of all things. We do experience God's love in our daily lives, in
              our families and churches and with our neighbors, but we also
              experience lots of pain and trauma and, yes, death.
            </p>
            <p>
              [At this point, I picked up a ukulele and played along during the
              next paragraphs.]
            </p>
            <p>
              In the roots music that Rod loved so much there's a very basic
              chord progression. I'm sure many of you are familiar, it's called
              ‚ÄúI-IV-V-I‚Äù. The one (I) chord represents stasis or rest. Four (IV)
              represents movement away from the still center point. Five (V) is
              the height of tension. Sometimes the tension is amplified with a
              dominant seventh note, before finally resolving back to the one
              (I) chord.
            </p>
            <p>
              How does this apply? One (I)‚Äîwe're in the Garden of Eden, enjoying
              unbroken sweet communion with God our creator. Four (IV)‚Äîthe fall,
              the crisis, we lose sight, we lose touch, we're cast out, we're
              lost and wandering and forgetful. Now the five (V) chord‚ÄîWhat's
              this? Something new! An intervention, a breaking in from on high.
              Incarnation, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, Session. The
              tension heightens with the dominant seventh ... and what's it
              resolve to? One (I)! That's right!
            </p>
            <p>
              But not yet! Already and not yet means we live in that five (V)
              chord, quite often with a dominant seventh or some other even more
              discordant note in there. This is our life that we know, the life
              that Rod finished on Monday. Some of us have faith that the song
              will resolve in the end. Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ
              will come again! But for now we each have our own cross to bear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod's approach to living in the already and not yet is summed up
              in a verse from Psalm 62. My brother Seth had his coworkers at
              Giant Eagle put it on the cake that we'll enjoy downstairs later
              today. ‚ÄúFor God alone my soul in silence waits.‚Äù Rod walked
              through this life with faith in Christ, leaning particularly on
              forms of silent prayer rooted in the Jesus Prayer: ‚ÄúLord Jesus
              Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's spend a few minutes reflecting on Rod's life of faith in the
              already and not yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              ROD'S FATHER, Charles Whitacre, was an Iowa farm boy, top of his
              class, captain of the football team, captain of the basketball
              team, dreams of becoming a doctor. But he enrolled in the Air
              Force after Hitler invaded Poland, and on his third bombing run
              the German boys downed his plane after he bombed them and he
              finished out the war in one of their camps, and when he reached
              back home a hero his high school sweetheart had cheated on him and
              the church rejected them both, so he married a young Amish girl
              instead and before long he flew Leah Whitacre and their infant son
              Rodney up to Washington State in a tiny plane with a propellor he
              made by hand. Charles never went back. His sons never knew their
              grandfather. Leah took Rod and the twins, Tim and Tom, to a
              Methodist church, but Charles was done with organized religion and
              dreams and he lived out his life as a humble house painter on the
              banks of the Columbia River in a government town a few miles from
              the Manhattan Project Hanford Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >For God alone, my soul in silence waits.<br />Lord Jesus
                Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Charles Whitacre's firstborn son Rodney took an interest in
              religion at a young age. He was as sharp as his dad and didn't
              have PTSD from the war or a small town church. Charles faithfully
              drove him to all the bible studies and youth groups, and sat
              quietly sipping Schlitz in his old painting van outside. He didn't
              understand his son's interest in religion and scholarship, but he
              didn't mind it. All he wanted for him was to not end up a painter.
              Charles and Leah supported Rod selflessly. Tinkering in the garage
              on one occasion, Rod shared about an evangelist, eagerly hoping it
              would spark a spiritual conversation. All he got was, ‚ÄúSon, Billy
              Graham is a rich man.‚Äù Over the decades Rod learned to let his dad
              work out his own salvation with Schlitz and silent, selfless love.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >For God alone my soul in silence waits.<br />Lord Jesus Christ,
                Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod transferred from Whitman College in Washington State (which is
              where he met Steve Smith, by the way) to Gordon College outside
              Boston where he met my mother Margaret at Park Street Church. They
              were married in 1972. He did his graduate work at Gordon-Conwell
              Seminary (which is where he met Geoff Chapman, by the way). Rod
              and Margaret moved to England in 1976 for his doctoral work, and
              that's where my brother Seth and I were born. My brother had
              seizures when he was young, and my father recalled staying up all
              night praying the Jesus Prayer and fishing his young son's tongue
              out of his throat.
            </p>

              <em

                Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod moved the family to Sewickley in the summer of 1983. One of my
              own earliest memories is walking up with my dad and brother from
              Chestnut Street to knock on the door at 822 Centennial Avenue to
              meet Steve and Peggy Noll and their five children for the first
              time. The 1980s were a time of excitement, working together with
              colleagues like Steve Noll and Steve Smith and Les Fairfield and
              Mike Henning and Terry Kelshaw and John Rodgers to build a new
              seminary with a mission under God to bring renewal to the
              Episcopal Church. My father was ordained to the priesthood in 1987
              and served as an assistant, with Rodge Wood at Christ Church,
              North Hills, with Scott Quinn at Church of the Nativity, and later
              with John Porter and others here at Grace Church. Teaching was his
              primary ministry, however, along with scholarship. He taught Greek
              and New Testament classes to a generation of students at Trinity.
              Summer Greek was a rite of passage for many. He taught many
              classes that were open to the public, both at Trinity and at
              churches in the area, and he continued teaching after his
              retirement up until the pandemic. Rod published a commentary on
              the Gospel of John in 1999, and later published several Greek
              textbooks, including a major Greek grammar just two years ago. But
              ultimately renewal was not God's plan, and my dad left the
              Episcopal Church in the late 1990s.

              And of course Rod loved playing the ukulele. This interest began
              with the soundtrack from the movie
              <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em> and evolved to become an
              important part of my dad's life. He loved sharing roots music with
              people, whether at ukulele lunches at Trinity or at Roots Jam here
              at Grace Church or at home with his grandkids or at bluegrass
              festivals with Seth. During one of our conversations in the
              hospital earlier this year, he was reflecting on his life and
              going over the books he had published. And then he remembered the
              Roots Jam book, a songbook he lovingly compiled and edited over
              the past 15 or 20 years that he used for leading sing-a-longs, and
              he got all choked up, and he said through tears, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I
              did have an impact. Roots Jam at least seems to really have made
              some people happy.‚Äù

              Rod's parents died in the 1990s of cancer linked to radiation from
              the Manhattan Project Hanford Site. Leah died first. Rod flew back
              home to Washington State when it was time, and when he arrived at
              the hospital he found his father and two younger brothers at her
              bedside. She died a minute later, waiting only for his arrival to
              be at peace. With Leah gone, Charles started to die soon after. If
              you have ears to hear it, my dad miraculously experienced the
              distinct, audible voice of his father calling to him from his home
              hospice care in Washington State, asking him to leave Pittsburgh
              to come and help him. Rod handed off the remaining two weeks of
              Summer Greek to Ann Castro, and went home. He cared for Charles in
              the final days of his life. At the end, Rod was singing ‚ÄúSwing
              Low, Sweet Chariot,‚Äù and Charles was breathing when he started and
              wasn't when he finished.

              When Jessica first came home with me from college, her first
              encounter with Rod Whitacre was at the breakfast table over a bowl
              of cereal. The first thing he said to her, his attempt at small
              talk with his future daughter-in-law, was, ‚ÄúSo what do you think
              it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit?‚Äù Rod officiated at our
              marriage a few years later. Today, we are burying him on our 23rd
              wedding anniversary.

              In college I was taking a summer class, and I got in a car
              accident on the way to the midterm. I barely avoided a head-on
              collision with a semi truck on the boulevard down here by the old
              Sewickley Country Inn. I was shaken up but kept driving, but soon
              thought better of it and called my parents from a pay phone to
              come and bring me home. Now, hugging was not my dad's love
              language. That was gift-giving. My condolences to Amazon.com,
              because they just lost one of their best customers. My dad bought
              Seth a new chess set just last week, and we already have about 25
              chess sets in the house, right mom? Anyway I love a good hug, and
              when we got home my dad just hugged me for a long time, and I
              cried all over him, and that was the safest I've ever felt in the
              world, and a week ago when he was dying I was sitting with him
              holding hands and I told him about that time and he smiled and
              teared up and squeezed my hands and I said, ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù and he
              said, ‚ÄúI love you, too,‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúI don't know who's holding
              who right now but this is the safest I've ever felt in the world
              again.‚Äù

              When Rod died two days later, his friend Seth was holding one hand
              and his friend Margie was holding the other, and by that point two
              hospice nurses had new copies of an IVP commentary on the Gospel
              of John on their shelves, and one had her first Bible, and at
              least one had unburdened herself of her life confession to a
              gentle man of God, and all of them had commented on how grateful
              and kind he was even to the end. I blessed him one more time in
              the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit with
              the oil from the shrine of Saint John the Wonderworker we had been
              using all along, and mom and Seth and Jess and I and the kids sang
              ‚ÄúSwing Low, Sweet Chariot‚Äù and other songs, and he was breathing
              when we started, and he wasn't when we finished. It was holy and
              beautiful and a fitting end for a faithful servant of God.

              ROD'S FAVORITE SPIRITUAL WRITING outside of the Scriptures was the
              book <em>Wholly for God</em>, a series of extracts from the
              writings of William Law, edited by Andrew Murray. Once, when I was
              sitting with him approaching his death, my dad had me read a
              selection to him. I'd like to read a portion of that to you now.
              This is under the heading, ‚ÄúThe Perfection of the Spirit of Love.‚Äù
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Oh, sir, would you know the blessing of all blessings? It is the
                God of love dwelling in your soul, and killing every root of
                bitterness which is the pain and torment of every earthly,
                selfish love. For all wants are satisfied, all disorders of
                nature are removed, no life is any longer a burden, every day is
                a day of peace, ever thing you meet becomes a help to you,
                because every thing you see or do is all done in the sweet,
                gentle element of love.

              Leah, Miriam, Samuel, Ruth: Papa Rod loved each of you a whole
              lot, hashtag hashbrowns. Jessica: Rod loved you, filled with the
              Holy Spirit. Seth: dad loved you as a friend and brother that
              you'll be with again soon, singing songs and watching the grass
              grow. Margaret, Mumsie, honey girl, Margie: Rod was your friend,
              who loved you faithfully as Christ loves the Church and gave
              Himself for her, that she might be sanctified and cleansed with
              the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to
              Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such
              thing, but that she might be holy and without blemish.

              Friends: Rod Whitacre loved us with God's love. He showed us how
              to live well in the already and not yet, in the age of the five
              (V) chord, of unresolved tension. Every soul in this sanctuary and
              beyond carries stories like those I've shared from Rod's life,
              joys and sorrows, precious and life-giving crosses that God offers
              each of us to bear for His glory and our salvation.

              At this point, we're going to have a time of silent prayer (I
              think this is what my dad would want). Eulogy means a good word,
              and there is no better word than the name of Jesus, who is the
              Wisdom, and Power, and Word of God, and God Almighty. So I'm going
              to say, ‚ÄúFor God alone my soul in silence waits,‚Äù and then, if you
              are able to, I invite you to say the Jesus Prayer together with
              me, ‚ÄúLord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.‚Äù
              Then we'll pray the Jesus Prayer silently for one minute. Then
              I'll repeat, "For God alone," we'll say the Prayer a final time,
              and I'll close my remarks.

              Rodney Alan Whitacre was a saint, a spiritual giant. He was not
              perfect, but through the mercy and grace of God, he bore his cross
              well. May we honor him by doing likewise, in full hope of the
              resurrection, and may his memory be eternal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
              Amen. ‚úö
