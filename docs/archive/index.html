      content="Celebrating the life of Rod Whitacre  Rodney Alan WhitacreDecember 28, 1949 – May 22, 2023 Obituary &nbsp;✚&nbsp; Eulogy &nbsp;✚&nbsp; Photos  Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, author, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God. In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care. I'll soon be free from earthly trials.This body'll sleep in the churchyard.I'll drop this weight of all that's vile,and go singing home to God.&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for journeying with us as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!"

                  is a hybrid between the common methods currently available and
                  an inductive method. It begins with several lessons that
                  provide students with an overview of the language, including
                  major features of morphology and sentence structure. After the
                  initial lessons there is a constant focus on the Greek text.

                <p>
                  Thank you to everyone who joined us on Saturday for Rod's
                  funeral and burial. We packed 180 of us into Grace, Edgeworth,
                  and we honored him well. Many of you were unable to be with us
                  due to weddings and graduations and a busy holiday weekend. We
                  felt your presence in the Spirit, and it's wonderful that so
                  many happier life milestones accompanied my father's burial.
                </p>

                  Below is the text of the eulogy I gave at the funeral service.
                  Several of you asked for it, and I would like it to be part of
                  the record of his singing home.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do you have pictures or videos of the funeral? Can you send
                  them to me? Our family would love to have them to remember the
                  event by, and I would like to include a few in a final email
                  to you all, along with some other photos from Rod's life.

                  <strong>Rodney Alan Whitacre</strong>, 73, of Sewickley,
                  Pennsylvania, went to be with the Lord on May 22, 2023. He
                  passed peacefully in his home from lymphoma, with his loving
                  family by his side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rod was born on December 28, 1949 to Charles and Leah (Keller)
                  Whitacre in Des Moines, Iowa. He grew up in Richland,
                  Washington, on the banks of the Columbia River in southeastern
                  Washington State. When a child, Rod was baptized in the
                  Methodist Church and fell in love with the Bible. By the time
                  he was in junior high school he was active in a small
                  inter-denominational mission and headed towards full-time
                  ministry in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After graduating from Richland High School, Washington in
                  1968, Rod went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Biblical and
                  Theological Studies from Gordon College in Wenham,
                  Massachusetts (1972), a Master of Theological Studies from
                  Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Hamilton, Massachusetts
                  (1976), and a Ph.D. in New Testament from Cambridge
                  University, England (1980). He was later awarded an honorary
                  Doctor of Divinity from Cranmer Theological House, Dallas,
                  Texas.

                  If you've sat under Rod Whitacre's teaching for more than five
                  minutes, you've likely heard the concept of the already and
                  the not yet. We live between times, between Christ's first
                  coming in humility and His second coming in glory. His Kingdom
                  is already present with us, but not yet fully realized. If
                  you've played roots music with Rod, it's likely been out of
                  the <em>Already &amp; Not Yet</em> songbook he lovingly
                  compiled and edited over the past fifteen years.

                  home. He told me he has lost all remaining interest in songs
                  like “Froggie Went A-Courtin'.” He only has ears for “Angel

                  Thanks for following along with Rod Whitacre's journey home,
                  and welcome to those who signed up in the past few weeks. You
                  can catch up on past emails in the

                    >archive</a
                  >. We're up over 200 subscribers. Rod has received messages
                  from over 150 of you. I usually share your messages with him
                  within a day or two of receiving them, even if I'm not able to
                  reply right away.

                  My dad said recently, "Certainly a lot of these are surprising
                  to me. I'm very thankful. It's too easy just to see your own
                  failures and sin and not acknowledge the way God has used you
                  to help others." Then he pulled out an aphorism I hadn't heard
                  before: "You can count the seeds in an apple, but you can't
                  count the apples in a seed." I thought that was fitting.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for your continued love and prayers! 🙏</p>

                  The cancer is progressing. After a couple weeks of relative
                  comfort, he recently increased his pain medication, because he
                  has noticed pain spreading from his abdomen into his legs.
                  Even so, he remains clear-minded (when he's awake), and his
                  spirits are strong. “I’m surprisingly at peace with spending
                  the rest of my life in this bed. That’s God’s mercy and the
                  prayers of his people somehow.” Here's a picture of the view
                  from his bed.

                  Rod greatly appreciates your messages of love and
                  encouragement, and the memories you are sharing. I've read all
                  of them to him through yesterday morning (we're up to about
                  80) though I'm still a little backlogged on sending out
                  individual replies. Hopefully this weekend I can catch up.
                  Thanks for your patience.

                  My dad is comfortable at home and sleeps most of the day. He's
                  recovered enough clarity of mind to spend a few minutes a day
                  putting the finishing touches on one final project, a workbook
                  to accompany his

                  painfully typing with two fingers."

                  We don't expect 25 years (though God's will be done!).
                  According to a nurse, one likely scenario is that Rod will
                  linger in his present state for several weeks, and then
                  decline rapidly. My mother and I visited Sewickley Cemetery
                  today. We found a "<a

                  valley.

                  I've been gradually reading all of your wonderful email
                  messages to my dad these past few days. At one point he was
                  overwhelmed with emotion, "people really want to say something
                  to me." One of the main lessons he learned from his arduous
                  time in the hospital was what it means to be loved, by God and
                  by others. "I've been talking about this stuff my whole life,
                  now I'm really experiencing it." Thank you all for your great
                  love for my dad!

                  Here are a couple pictures from yesterday of Rod with his kids
                  and (most of) his grandkids. We're having some sweet moments
                  together despite discomfort, lack of mobility and energy, and
                  some difficulty breathing. Now that we're through the first
                  flurry of activity moving back home and getting settled, we'll
                  see how the days progress. I expect I'll check in again here
                  late in the week or over the weekend.

                <p>
                  Rod arrived back at the house on Thursday evening, March 2. He
                  is comfortable in a hospital bed downstairs in the family
                  room, with a little bit of oxygen and regular medication,
                  primarily for pain management. He has a nice view into the
                  back yard with trees and birds, and he has his iPod with lots
                  of favorite songs that he enjoys listening to. His grandkids
                  have been able to visit and he is having final conversations
                  with them and others in the family. Rod asks your forgiveness
                  for any hurt he has caused.
                </p>

                  We are not sure how long he has left with us. It could be
                  days, or weeks, or possibly even months. The theme of this
                  website and email was chosen because of Rod's love for roots
                  music as a way to bring people together in community and
                  fellowship with one another and with God. Here is a video from
                  a while back of Rod talking about two of his favorite
                  subjects, roots music and biblical theology:
