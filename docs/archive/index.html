      content="Celebrating the life of Rod Whitacre  Rodney Alan WhitacreDecember 28, 1949 – May 22, 2023 Obituary &nbsp;✚&nbsp; Archive  Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, author, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God. In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care. I'll soon be free from earthly trials.This body'll sleep in the churchyard.I'll drop this weight of all that's vile,and go singing home to God.&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for journeying with us as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things! &nbsp;"
