      ---

      Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitacregreek.com/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God.

      In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.

      &lt;span style=&quot;display: block; font-style: italic; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ll soon be free from earthly trials.&lt;br&gt;This body&#x27;ll sleep in the churchyard.&lt;br&gt;I&#x27;ll drop this weight of all that&#x27;s vile,&lt;br&gt;and go singing home to God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

      Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://singinghome.com/archive/&quot;&gt;journeying with us&lt;/a&gt; as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!",

              is a hybrid between the common methods currently available and an
              inductive method. It begins with several lessons that provide
              students with an overview of the language, including major
              features of morphology and sentence structure. After the initial
              lessons there is a constant focus on the Greek text.

              <em>Learning Greek Passage by Passage</em> complements Rod's

              (Eerdmans, 2021). It is meant to be useful not only in formal
              courses but also informal classes in churches or elsewhere, as
              well as individual study. The New Testament is the primary focus
              for most people using this method, but you will also be able to
              read the Old Testament in Greek as well as a variety of other
              texts, both Christian and non-Christian.
            </p>
            <p>From the preface:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I am grateful to all the students who have studied Greek with me
                over the years, especially those in recent years who have used
                various drafts of this method. I am particularly thankful to
                Tara Jernigan for feedback after she stepped in at late notice
                to teach the second semester of basic Greek in 2023 when illness
                prevented me from doing so. Adding a course to her class load,
                especially an unusual method midstream in a course, was an act
                of great generosity.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Thank you indeed to Tara for finishing out my dad's last class,
              and for helping with final corrections to the text.
            </p>
            <h2>Rod's Parting Gift to Us</h2>
            <p>
              Rod made it clear that
              <em>Learning Greek Passage by Passage</em> was to be released for
              free download and as low cost as possible in print. He wanted it
              to be his final gift to students everywhere. In God's providence,
              I found the following email in my dad's inbox while preparing the
              book, from someone who had not heard of his passing.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I have been recently going through your Greek Grammar (A Grammar
                of New Testament Greek) and I love it. I came across it because
                I was interested in the new approach with "Learning Greek
                Passage by Passage: A Modified Text-Based Approach for Koine
                Greek." Since then I have been looking forward to the text but I
                see no sign of it being out there and 2023 is in its second
                half.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I wanted to enquire when the text will be ready, and if there
                is any way I can access it at the moment? Forgive my boldness, I
                am in love with your work, eager to learn Greek and I want to
                get into reading ASAP.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I shared the news of Rod's passing along with the PDF of the book,
              and received the following reply.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I am in love with your father's work. He really has been
                impactful to me in my journey learning Greek, and I am so
                appreciative of him.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's sad to hear of his passing, to me he shall forever live on
                in my Greek and in his wonderful works.
              </p>
              <p>
                I leave you with this verse, Psalmâ€¬ â€­116:15â€¬ â€­(KJVâ€¬â€¬): "Precious
                in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." We have
                this precious hope that one day we shall meet Rodney again, I
                definitely want to be there to meet him and thank him.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              By God's grace, it seems that my dad's wish for his last book is
              already fulfilled. Thank you (you know who you are) for being part
              of this story. How wonderful it is to be able to accompany the

              Thank you all. Fear God and keep His commandments. Pray for the
              repose of the soul of His servant Rodney and for the pardon and
              remission of his sins. May his memory be eternal!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Glory to God!</strong></p>

On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to "go singing home to God." He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.\n\n<span style="display: block; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">I\'ll soon be free from earthly trials.<br>This body\'ll sleep in the churchyard.<br>I\'ll drop this weight of all that\'s vile,<br>and go singing home to God.<br><br>"Wayfaring Stranger"</span>\n\nRod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for <a href="https://singinghome.com/archive/">journeying with us</a> as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!',
