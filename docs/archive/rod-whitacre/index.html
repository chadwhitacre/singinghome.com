      ---

      Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitacregreek.com/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;, priest, spiritual counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband ... but most of all a servant of God.

      In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023, he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to &quot;go singing home to God.&quot; He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.

      &lt;span style=&quot;display: block; font-style: italic; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;ll soon be free from earthly trials.&lt;br&gt;This body&#x27;ll sleep in the churchyard.&lt;br&gt;I&#x27;ll drop this weight of all that&#x27;s vile,&lt;br&gt;and go singing home to God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

      Rod died on May 22. Thank you for your prayers and love and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://singinghome.com/archive/&quot;&gt;journeying with us&lt;/a&gt; as Rod went singing home. Glory to God for all things!",

              <strong>Rodney Alan Whitacre</strong>, 73, of Sewickley,
              Pennsylvania, went to be with the Lord on May 22, 2023. He passed
              peacefully in his home from lymphoma, with his loving family by
              his side.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod was born on December 28, 1949 to Charles and Leah (Keller)
              Whitacre in Des Moines, Iowa. He grew up in Richland, Washington,
              on the banks of the Columbia River in southeastern Washington
              State. When a child, Rod was baptized in the Methodist Church and
              fell in love with the Bible. By the time he was in junior high
              school he was active in a small inter-denominational mission and
              headed towards full-time ministry in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating from Richland High School, Washington in 1968,
              Rod went on to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Biblical and
              Theological Studies from Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts
              (1972), a Master of Theological Studies from Gordon-Conwell
              Theological Seminary in Hamilton, Massachusetts (1976), and a
              Ph.D. in New Testament from Cambridge University, England (1980).
              He was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Cranmer
              Theological House, Dallas, Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod was Director of the New Testament Greek program at
              Gordon-Conwell Seminary in Hamilton, Mass from 1981 to 1983 before
              moving to Pennsylvania to become New Testament professor at
              Trinity School for Ministry in Ambridge. He authored a commentary
              on the Gospel of John along with several Greek text books, and was
              a well-loved teacher, counselor and mentor from 1983 until his
              retirement in 2015. After retirement Rod continued to teach,
              sharing with students his love for the Word of God. Rod was an
              ordained priest in the Reformed Episcopal Church. For many years
              he served as part-time assisting priest at Grace Anglican Church,
              Edgeworth, where he also led a monthly acoustic music Roots Jam.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rod is survived by Margaret, his wife of 50 years, son, Seth, son
              and daughter-in-law, Chad and Jessica, four grandchildren, Leah,
              Miriam, Samuel, and Ruth, all of Sewickley. He is also survived by
              two brothers Timothy Whitacre and Thomas Whitacre of Potlatch,
              Idaho.
            </p>
            <p>Rod’s hobbies included playing ukulele, guitar, and chess.</p>
            <p>
              All are invited to a funeral service at Grace Anglican Church, 325
              Church Lane, Sewickley, PA 15143, on Saturday, May 27, 2023 at
              10:00 AM, followed by burial in Sewickley Cemetery, and a Roots
              Jam reception at Grace Church from 1:00 PM until the evening. In
