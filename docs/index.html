            Rod Whitacre was a beloved professor, scholar,
            <a href="https://whitacregreek.com/">author</a>, priest, spiritual
            counselor, ukulele player, friend, father, grandfather, and husband
            ... but most of all a servant of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October of 2022, Rod started to develop symptoms of lymphoma
            related to his October, 2018 kidney transplant. On January 19, 2023,
            he entered the hospital. Forty days later he made the decision to
            forego additional chemotherapy, and instead to "go singing home to
            God." He came home on March 2 for home hospice care.
